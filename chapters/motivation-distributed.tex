Today almost all computer systems are distributed, for different reasons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Geography
	\item Parallelism - speed up computation
	\item Reliability - prevent data loss
	\item Availability - allow for access at any time, without bottlenecks, minimizing latency
\end{itemize}

Even though distributed systems have many benefits, such as increased storage or computational power, they also introduce challenging coordination problems.
